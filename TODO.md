This is the roadmap for future work: 

1. ~~Catching fatal errors generated by Pandoc.~~

2. Redirecting a user to the last page seen after login.

3. Recording and displaying page history.

4. Interactivity for readers via Javascript, i.e. voting, rating.

5. Transclusion of text from other pages. 

6. Learning about the difference between pandoc and pandoc-server as backends. 

7. K-means clustering. 

8. Perpetual scroll based on page similarity. 

9. Touch event navigation, i.e. swipe right to edit, left to go to a random page.
